            <li>2 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge.</li>
            <li>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</li>
            <li>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
